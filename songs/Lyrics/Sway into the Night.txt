Lyrics

[Verse 1]
We hit the town, the lights are shining bright
Every step we take feels so right
It's the end of the day but we just begun
Dancing through the night, having all the fun
Memories flashback, we're on a roll
Feeling that beat deep down in our soul

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy, let the music play
Nostalgia's calling, we're here to stay
Party all night, till the break of day
Feel the rhythm, we'll sway and sway

[Verse 2]
Pictures on the wall from days gone by
But tonight we're stars, we touch the sky
Old school beats mixed with a modern flair
Every moment counts 'cause we're beyond compare
Friends all around, and the spirits high
We'll chase our dreams, let our worries fly

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy, let the music play
Nostalgia's calling, we're here to stay
Party all night, till the break of day
Feel the rhythm, we'll sway and sway

[Bridge]
Feel the pulse, the magic in the air
We're unstoppable, beyond all compare
Turn up the volume, don't ever care
Tonightâ€™s our night, let's take the dare

[Chorus]
Let's go crazy, let the music play
Nostalgia's calling, we're here to stay
Party all night, till the break of day
Feel the rhythm, we'll sway and sway
