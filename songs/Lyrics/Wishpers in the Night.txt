Lyrics

[Verse 1]
Under the moonlight, hearts intertwined
Whispered secrets, your hand in mine
Rhythms of love beat
Feel the magic so sweet
Our souls are bound tight
In this dance tonight

[Chorus]
Love's call, hear it softly
Love's call, won't you answer?
Love's call, feel it whisper
Love's call, come and get close

[Verse 2]
Through the sand and the stars, our destinies meet
In the pulse of the night, where our spirits greet
Electric our connection
In every direction
Just follow the beat
Feel the heat complete

[Chorus]
Love's call, hear it softly
Love's call, won't you answer?
Love's call, feel it whisper
Love's call, come and get close

[Bridge]
In the heart of the night
Two worlds ignite
Hold me close, donâ€™t let go
Let our love show

[Chorus]
Love's call, hear it softly
Love's call, won't you answer?
Love's call, feel it whisper
Love's call, come and get close
