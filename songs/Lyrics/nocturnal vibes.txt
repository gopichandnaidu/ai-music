Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Pint glass, raise it up
In the DJ's beat
Pub crowd, feel the love
Stompin’ to the heat
No rest, no chillin’ out
The party's in our feet
We are the night owls
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go
[Chorus]
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
We are the night owls, let’s go, let’s go
[Build]
(Go...)
We are the night owls, let’s go, let’s go (Go!)
[Drop]
[Verse 2]
Turn up, make it loud
'Til the pub walls shake
Pub crowd, feel the sound
Hearts begin to quake
Pint glass, raise it up, in the DJ’s beat
We are the night owls, let’s go, let’s go
[Chorus]
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
We are the night owls, let’s go, let’s go
[Bridge]
(Go...)
Dance until the morning light (Go!)
Feel the rhythm, hold it tight
We are the night owls, let’s go, let’s go
[Chorus]
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
We are, we are, we are, the night owls
